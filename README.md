# UnityEditorGraphsNet4Patch
Patch for UnityEditor.Graphs API makes it working with .NET 4.x

Look for UnityEditorGraphsNet4Patch.unitypackage in releases. Or just copy Fiftytwo to Assets.

Thanks to Harmony project for possibility of modifying .NET code on the fly: https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony
