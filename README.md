# UnityEditorGraphsNet4Patch
Patch for UnityEditor.Graphs API makes it working with .NET 4.x

Look for UnityEditorGraphsNet4Patch.unitypackage in releases. Or just copy Fiftytwo to Assets.

This patch will not be needed after Unity fixes the issue: https://fogbugz.unity3d.com/default.asp?1057751_v6pjssp2a7ah8a2h

Thanks to Harmony project for possibility of modifying .NET code on the fly: https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony
